      <h1>About Dr. Almaz Desta Zewde, President</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Empowering the Farmers Inc.</strong> is led by Dr. Almaz Desta Zewde, whose roots
        are deeply entrenched in the fertile soils of northern Ethiopia, Tigray, in Wereda
        Glumakeda, Kushet Kilaat. Dr. Zewde's early experiences in Kilaat, where she grew up
        surrounded by the bounty of her family's garden and the local farming community, shaped
        her lifelong commitment to agriculture and sustainable living. Her father, a dedicated
        farmer, instilled in her the value of producing one's own food, ranging from tomatoes
        and onions to tropical fruits like oranges, bananas, and mangoes, and the importance of
        local produce such as fresh milk and honey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Zewde's academic journey took her from elementary school in Kilaat to Agazi High School
        in Adigrat for grades 7 through 11, culminating in her graduation from Atse Yohannes High
        School in Mekelle. Her education laid a solid foundation for her later achievements and her
        return to Ethiopia after studying in the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her return visit to Tigray in 1993 was a turning point. Shocked by the transformation of her
        vibrant, green childhood vista into a drought-stricken landscape, Dr. Zewde felt a powerful
        call to action. This feeling intensified following the devastating conflict in Tigray on
        November 4, 2020, which resulted in significant loss of life and displacement, with many
        fleeing to safety in Sudan and elsewhere. The local farming infrastructure suffered
        immensely, with equipment looted or destroyed and livestock decimated.
      </p>
      <p>
        In response to this crisis, Dr. Zewde founded <strong>Empowering the Farmers Inc.</strong>
        in September 2023. This nonprofit organization, based in the United States and recognized as
        a 501(c)(3) entity with EIN# 93-2644193, is dedicated to rebuilding and empowering the
        farming communities in Tigray and surrounding regions. The mission is clear: to restore a
        semblance of normalcy to the lives of local farmers by providing essential farming tools and
        support, free from political influence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr. Zewde's leadership and vision drive <strong>Empowering the Farmers Inc.</strong> to not
        only address immediate agricultural needs but also to foster sustainable practices that will
        ensure the resilience and productivity of the farming community for generations to come.
      </p>
      <p>Thank you for joining us in our mission to revitalize the heartlands of Tigray and beyond.</p>
